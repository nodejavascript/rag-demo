/**
 * consent.ts — the cookie gate, and the only thing on this page that may load
 * Google's script.
 *
 * The model is the same one inputresponse.com and llm-demo use, and it is the same
 * for the same reason. The law that shapes it is the European one, broadly copied
 * now by the United Kingdom, Brazil, Quebec and others: storage that is not strictly
 * necessary for the thing the visitor actually asked for may not be set until they
 * say yes, and saying no has to be as easy as saying yes. Counting somebody as a
 * statistic because they loaded a page is the exact thing the rule was written about.
 *
 * So nothing here is clever:
 *
 *   - **The Google Analytics script is NOT in the page.** It is appended only after
 *     a yes, which means a declined visit makes no request to Google at all and
 *     receives no cookie. Not "cookies disabled" — never loaded. The end-to-end tests
 *     assert both halves: no consent, no request, `window.gtag` undefined.
 *   - The choice is remembered in localStorage rather than a cookie, because setting
 *     a cookie to record a cookie decision would be its own small joke.
 *   - Accept and Reject are the same size, the same weight and the same distance from
 *     the reader. There is no pre-ticked box and no "manage preferences" maze with
 *     the off switch three screens down.
 *   - Rejecting is a real answer, not a nag: the bar does not return on the next visit.
 *   - The longer answer is a panel, not a maze. Every purpose is named rather than
 *     numbered, and the ONE switch starts off — a box that arrives already ticked is
 *     a default, not a choice.
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT HERE, and it is the whole point of writing this page's own copy
 * rather than reusing the sibling's: **this demo asks people to paste something they
 * care about.** A diary, a resume, a set of terms, a medical letter. So the ask has to
 * say the one thing that matters before anything else — that the text you paste is
 * never sent to Google, whatever you answer here. That sentence is not a nicety on
 * this page; it is the reason the page is worth trusting at all.
 *
 * AND THIS SITE HAS NO STRICTLY NECESSARY COOKIE AT ALL. That is checked, not
 * assumed: the document id the server hands back rides in the request body and lives
 * in this tab's memory, so there is no session cookie to carry it and nothing to
 * describe as essential. The panel therefore names ONE real choice instead of
 * inventing categories to look thorough.
 */
