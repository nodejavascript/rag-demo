/**
 * faults.ts — when this page breaks on somebody else's machine, it says so.
 *
 * 🔴 WHY THIS IS NOT BEHIND THE COOKIE BAR, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A LOOPHOLE.
 * Everything else on this page that transmits runs only after the visitor says
 * yes. This one does not, and the reason is not that it is more convenient — it
 * is that a fault on a reader's device is otherwise invisible for ever. The page
 * would be broken for that reader, nothing would say so, and nobody could fix
 * it. That is the test for a strictly necessary signal, and this meets it: it
 * exists to make a breakage fixable, it is what the reader's own request depends
 * on, and there is no version of it that waits for an answer without leaving the
 * breakage unknown in the meantime.
 *
 * Because it is not a choice, it is declared rather than offered. The cookie
 * panel carries it as a **Required** row with no switch — a switch would be a
 * control that pretends to do something — and the panel's question says plainly
 * that pressing Reject all stops Google and does NOT stop this. A panel that let
 * a reader believe one button stopped both would be lying by layout.
 *
 * 🔴 IT IS NOT A COOKIE, AND IT KEEPS NOTHING.
 * No cookie is set, read or written; no `localStorage`; no `sessionStorage`; no
 * cache. What has already been reported for this page load is remembered in a
 * variable that dies with the tab. That is why the page's promise survives this
 * file being added, and a test asserts the claim rather than trusting the
 * paragraph.
 *
 * 🔴 IT POINTS AT THIS SITE AND AT NOTHING ELSE.
 * The endpoint is a path, `/api/fault`, on the page's own origin. There is no
 * second host anywhere in this file, and a test asserts that too. The choice is
 * deliberate and it is what keeps the other published promise true: *your
 * document never leaves this machine*. A fault reporter that posted straight to
 * a monitoring service would have broken that sentence, and no amount of copy
 * would have made it true again.
 *
 * 🔴 NO KEY IS IN THIS FILE, AND NONE IS NEEDED.
 * The report is relayed by this app's own server, which holds the credential.
 * So the public repository can carry this file: there is nothing in it worth
 * taking. That is the whole reason it was built this way.
 *
 * 🔴 NOTHING THE READER PASTED CAN BE IN IT, BECAUSE THIS FILE NEVER TOUCHES IT.
 * The document, the question, the answers and the index all live in this tab and
 * the server's own database, and **this file reads no storage and no DOM text at
 * all** — it cannot read the document even by accident, so no sentence from a
 * visitor's file can reach a report. What it does send is described field by
 * field below, and every field is capped again on the server, which does not
 * trust this file any more than it trusts a stranger.
 *
 * 🔴 AND THE REPORTER MUST NEVER BECOME THE INCIDENT. Every function here is
 * wrapped so that it cannot throw into the page it is watching: a refused POST,
 * a blocked beacon, storage switched off — all of them are silent, and none of
 * them change what the reader sees. That is the same rule the server's own
 * notifier follows, for the same reason.

   * 🔴 A CAUGHT ERROR IS INVISIBLE UNLESS THE CATCH SENDS IT.
   *
   * George, 23 September 2026, verbatim: ***"if you have any try/catch rollbar
   * wont get it unless to invoke the catch err and send to rollbar."*** He is
   * right, and it is the limitation people assume an error reporter does not
   * have. A reporter sees two things and only two:
   *
   *   - an error that ESCAPED — `window.onerror`, hooked above;
   *   - a promise NOBODY handled — `unhandledrejection`, hooked above.
   *
   * **Anything inside `try { } catch` has been caught, and catching it means the
   * page chose to carry on.** The browser then tells nobody, so a fault a reader
   * is quietly working around is a fault nobody can ever fix. That is the whole
   * gap, and no amount of listening closes it: **the catch has to say so.**
   *
   * So this entry point exists, and there are two ways to use it:
   *
   *     window.ragFault?.(error, "reading the document");  // a fault, send it
   *
   *     // expected: a private-mode refusal to store; the visit still works
   *
   * **A catch must do one or the other, and `test/faults.test.js` fails on a
   * catch that does neither** — because the failure this guards against is a
   * catch added in six months that quietly swallows something, and a rule
   * written in a comment cannot stop that. It is the same principle as the case
   * gate: a record is read at the end, only a gate fires at the moment of work.
   *
   * It goes through `report`, so the cap, the de-duplication and the redaction
   * all apply: a step failing on every poll is ONE item with many occurrences,
   * not hundreds of items.
   *
   * 🔴 IT NEVER THROWS, AND IT NEVER REPORTS ITS OWN FAILURE. A reporter that
   * threw into the catch that called it would replace a handled fault with an
   * unhandled one, and a reporter that reported its own failure would loop for
   * ever.
